    "- `301 Moved Permanently` – This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.\n",
    "- `404 Not Found` – The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future.\n",
    "- `500 Internal Server Error` – A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.\n",
