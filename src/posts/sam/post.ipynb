    "## Introduction \n",
    "This blogpost deals with a statistical analysis for gene expression microarray experiments, called __Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM)__ , that - despite the name - is not restricted for microarray analysis [1] but serves as a blue print for any permutation test.\n",
    "When performing a microarray of differentially expressed genes, you capture a snapshot of transcriptional activity in different biological states (for example control vs. heat stress) and want to identify differences in those states.  \n",
    "Therefore, all genes in a cell are measured, which leads to an immense amount of data __(high throughput method)__.\n",
    "Those experiments can be used to identify all __differentially expressed genes__, not only small subsets contrary to traditional approaches. \n",
    "Those identifications can lead to the __discovery of new functional roles or mechanisms__ of genes involved in (stress) responses. \n",
    "The main goal is therefore to identify all differentially expressed genes with a controlled number of false positives. \n",
    " \n",
    "This approach leads to the following problems handling immense datasets in contrast to traditional analysis:  \n",
    " \n",
    "- The need of computational capacity and  \n",
    "- the control of multiple testing errors \n",
    " \n",
    "The first one can be overcome easily nowadays, but the multiple testing errors remain a challenge. \n",
    "Hypothesis tests report a p value, that corresponds to the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. In other words: \n",
    "If there is no effect (no mean difference), a p value of 0.05 indicates that in 5 % of the tests a false positive is reported. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Example:__ You investigate 10.000 genes and perform standard t-tests. With a p value of 5 % (alpha level 0.05), on average 500 tests will be reported as significantly different \n",
    "without being different (false positives).\n",
    " \n",
    "Traditional statistical tests like t-tests were originally created to perform comparisons between one test only, not 10.000. \n",
    "With an increasing number of performed tests the probability of encountering false positives increases. \n",
    "This effect can be adjusted or minimized by applying correction methods. \n",
    "Correction methods, like Bonferroni, usually account for the number of performed tests, lowering the threshold (BonferroniThreshold) for calling a change significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=../../img/7_SAM/Bonferroni.png style=\"max-width:45%\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "With this lowered threshold it is more likely to miss true differentially expressed genes. \n",
    "Using the example from above, an alpha level of 0.05 and 10.000 performed tests results in a p value of 0.000005 for genes to be called significant. \n",
    "This high number of comparisons is not unusual in modern experiments and therefore needs a new approach to overcome the multiple testing error problem.  \n",
    "One approach is the usage of the __False-Discovery-Rate FDR__ instead of p values, for the reason that it is robust to false positives and is widely used in exploratory analysis where the goal is to have mostly true findings and a minimum of false positive findings. \n",
    "The FDR describes the rate of expected false positives in all significant findings.\n",
    "Another concern in differential gene expression analysis is failing to identify truly differentially expressed genes, which is why the FDR is used (as many true positives with minimum of false positives). For further information see the [q values BlogPost](https://csbiology.github.io/CSBlog/posts/q-values.html).\n",
    "A second approach is using __q values__, which are local FDRs of single genes in this case.\n",
    "Every gene with a greater significance than the one observed will be called significant, and provides a higher accuracy than conventional t-tests according to the initial publication of SAM [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution \n",
    "__SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) is a tool developed to overcome this multiple testing problem.__ It is a statistical method for multiple hypothesis testing and is mainly used for __differential gene expression analysis__. \n",
    "It is able to compare different biological states with thousands of genes without the loss of true positive findings due to before mentioned correction methods.\n",
    "The first application of SAM was studying the influence of ionizing radiation on the transcriptional response of lymphoblastoid cells in 2001[1].\n",
    "They found 34 differentially expressed genes, 19 involved in cell cycle regulation and 3 in apoptosis.  \n",
    " \n",
    "The focus is the comparison of different experimental states and to identify changes. \n",
    "To identify changes, it is crucial to know how the data would act if there is no change. \n",
    "But in biological experiments, it is often challenging to define the true null distribution (no change). \n",
    "This leads to a complex problem that needs a tailored solution. \n",
    "SAM accounts for this problem with a __combined permutation-bootstrap-method__. \n",
    "Bootstrap method here means that a new dataset is created out of the available observed data by random sampling and can be used as a no change reference __(synthetic null distribution)__. \n",
    "The relation of data to their treatment is lost  and therefore, each reported positive result is a false positive.\n",
    "To compare different states a statistic is calculated for each observed gene and the expected values from the bootstrap method (synthetic null distribution).\n",
    "More extreme statistics are more likely to be true changes and less likely to occur by chance.\n",
    "With a high statistic, the chances are high to find a real difference between control and treatment. \n",

    "For statistical comparisons, it is always important to have a reference, for example how the dataset would look like if there was a treatment, but no gene expression changed.\n",

    "In the default version, the data are permuted by a column-wise Fisher Yates shuffle.\n",
    "To gain the expected statistics for SAM, a few steps have to be performed. \n",

    "### pi0\n",
    "Pi0 is another coefficient to ensure that SAM does not overestimate the FDR. \n",
    "It is estimated as the __proportion of non-differentially-expressed-genes__ [2], so true positive null hypothesis. \n",
    "Multiplying it with the median false positive count helps getting closer to the real null distribution. \n",
    "To calculate pi0 the 25% and 75% quantile of relative differences of all performed permutations must be estimated, and the scores between those quantiles must be counted.\n",
    "Afterwards, the count must be divided through half the number of samples. \n",

    "Cell 2, in contrast, has a moderate response and only 2507 are significantly different expressed. \n",
    "The percentage of truly unchanged genes differs and the estimation of the null distribution relies only on the observed data. \n",
    "To account for this when calculating the median FDR, pi0 is included. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Delta \n",
    "The variable delta is the absolute difference between observed and expected statistic, and it is calculated for each gene.\n",
    "With using delta as distance, cutoffs in the statistics can be determined and those correspond to an FDR. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cuts\n",
    "Asymmetric cuts are implemented to this Version of SAM because they take the possibility into account that a change in gene expression is not necessarily symmetric. \n",
    "This can happen when more upregulation than downregulation is present, or vice versa, and is not uncommon in biological experiments. \n",

    "Every gene beyond that first exceeding threshold gene is called significant.\n",
    "To ensure that the differences are always increasing (or decreasing for the lower cut), a monotonizing function is applied.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### FDR\n",
    "To call a gene significant in SAM it must exceed a difference (delta) between observed and expected statistics. \n",
    "In this implemented version each absolute difference is calculated and used to determine the corresponding FDR. \n",
    "The FDR is determined by these steps: \n",
    "1. find cutoffs (here, asymmetric cutoffs). Every datapoint exceeding this cutoff is called significant. \n",

    "Another feature of SAM is the so-called local FDR or q Value, which is a gene specific value that gives the exact FDR at which that gene is called significant [3].  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations: \n",
    "The implemented default version can right now process two class unpaired data, while samR can process timecourse and paired data, as well as some other types.  \n",
    "The way of permuting data can be a limitation, and there may be more efficient or fitting ones for your experiment.\n",
    "However, SAM is designed to be modular and implementing your adapted permutation or statistic calculation is not a problem.  \n",
    "The last limitation of SAM is the estimation of the null distribution. \n",
    "Because it uses a bootstrap method and generates the distribution only from existing data, problems arise if a large percentage of the genes are differentially expressed. \n",
    "This can lead to a false null distribution, which is problematic because all calculations are based on the null distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternatives\n",
    "An alternative to SAM would be to perform multiple two sample t-tests and correct the p values subsequently. \n",
    "With this method the multiple testing errors would be a problem, and correction (e.g. Bonferroni) would lead to the loss of true positive findings.\n",
    "When working with high throughput data it is beneficial to use more tailored methods instead of the basic t test. \n",
    "SAM is a modular blue print for permutation tests, that is not limited to microarray data, but with alternative permutation patterns and exchangeable statistic calculations can be applied to several data (e.g. RNASeq, proteomics, and many more).\n",
