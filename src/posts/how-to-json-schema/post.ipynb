    "## What are JSON Schemas?\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common data format for storing data and metadata and widely used for data exchange purposes. It is easily human- as well as machine-readable. While JSON files and formats can be written in a simple and non-standardized way (as long as the syntax is respected), standardizing a specific JSON format might be useful when considering validation, documentation, and interaction control.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON Schemas are data models that are build out of JSON syntax themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSON syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the syntax of JSON is very simple and easy to understand, here's everything to know:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- A JSON file consists of at least one empty object\n",
    "- Objects are opened with `{` and closed with `}`\n",
    "- Objects consist of key/value (aka name/value) pairs. Keys (or names) are identifiers realized as strings, values are corresponding information realized via primitive data types, both are separated via the character `:`\n",
    "- There are 6 basic primitive data types:\n",
    "  - null: no value (`null`)\n",
    "  - boolean: `true` or `false` value\n",
    "  - number: decimal number value, e.g. `7` or `1.337`\n",
    "  - string: unicode text value, e.g. `\"Hello World!\"`\n",
    "  - object: unordered set of properties, consists of key/value pairs, e.g. `{ \"name\": \"Max Mustermann\", \"age\": 44 }`\n",
    "  - array: ordered list of instances, consists of values, e.g. `[ \"Hello \", \"World!\" ]`\n",
    "- As seen above, `,` is used to separate different key/value pairs in objects and instances in arrays\n",
    "- Objects can be nested infinitely\n",
    "- Scoping is similar to F#, both `[ \"Hello \", \"World!\" ]` as well as  \n",

    "  is possible\n",
    "\n",
    "## The basic structure of a JSON Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Since JSON Schemas are JSON files in a sense, they are written very similarly.  \n",
    "Let's develop a JSON schema for â€’ say â€“ future blogposts. It should consist of an identifier, a title, a category to which it belongs, a value if it is already uploaded or not, and an array of tags.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A finished JSON file following this schema should therefore look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"identifier\": 0,\n",
    "  \"title\": \"How to develop and use a JSON Schema\",\n",
    "  \"category\": \"Implementation\",\n",
    "  \"uploaded\": true,\n",
    "  \"tags\": [ \"implementation\", \"JSON\", \"standardization\" ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON Schemas must start with 2 unique key/value pairs that are referencing them as specific JSON Schemas:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\",\n",
    "  \"$id\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omaus/CSBlogpost/main/blogpost.schema.json\",\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first key, `\"$schema\"` references a JSON Schema to a so-called Metaschema, here of the ID \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\".  \n",
    "The value of second key, `\"$id\"`, is a unique identifier for this JSON Schema, typically in the form of a URI.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `$` is a special character and marks Schema-related keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's more to add: Our JSON Schema needs a title and a description:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\",\n",
    "  \"$id\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omaus/CSBlogpost/main/blogpost.schema.json\",\n",
    "  \"title\": \"Blogpost entry\",\n",
    "  \"description\": \"An entry of our blogpost series, consisting of an identifier, a title, a category, the upload status, and some tags.\",\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are called \"Schema Annotations\" since they annotate our Schema and provide some information about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing to add is a so-called \"Validation keyword\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",

    "  \"type\": \"object\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON files of our Schema must have a type. In our case, it's an object but the primitive data types as well as `integer` (a `number` without fractional parts) are also applicable. We will examine that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of other Schema Keywords, Schema Annotations and Validation Keywords. We will see some of them later but there are also some that are not important now and can be looked at later if required.\n",
