    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> In computer science, an ontology is a way of organizing knowledge in a structured and hierarchical manner. It consists of a set of classes or concepts, each with its own properties and relationships to other classes. Ontologies are used to help machines reason about information in a more intelligent and automated way, leading to more effective decision-making and problem-solving.  \n",
    "> -- <cite>ChatGPT<sup>[[1]](#references)</sup></cite>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ontologies, as we know them in computer science, hail from the concept of ontology in philosophy, more precisely, the field of metaphysics.  \n",
    "There, \"ontology\" describes the doctrine of being and existence. It is mainly about the categorization of entities (which can be abstract or material), of processes and properties, and of events. \n",
    "In this point, the philosophical concept of ontology agrees with that of computer science. The _ontology_ of computer science, however, does not focus on philosophical issues but on representations of the categorized concepts and their relations to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ontologies have become more and more important in computer science since they allow for a standardized set of terms (so-called _controlled vocabularies_) which describe the things you are engaging with and putting them in a structure, guided by rules. This way, it becomes easier for humans to learn and communicate about a topic since ontologies also have a teaching nature on the one hand, and for machines to order these terms in a similar way to human understanding on the other hand.  \n",
    "Especially in the field of research data management, ontologies prove very useful because they achieve a compromise between human- and machine-readability and thus may lead to fewer miscommunications and errors. In the **FAIR data principles**, the I (for interoparability) can be achieved with the help of ontologies. This is done in, for example, the DataPLANT consortium."

    "### Classes (& Instances)\n",
    "\n",
    "Very similarly to OOP, _classes_ are concepts (conceptual blueprints) of objects that can be instantiated (which results in an _instance_). If, e.g., there is the _class_ \"Cat\", \"Garfield\" would be an _instance_ of it.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Objects in an ontology can be _related_ to one another.  \n",
    "Beneath a set of ontology-specific individual relations, there are some relations that are seen in many ontologies or even every one:  \n",
    "- is_a: Describes the relation between a subclass and a class which leads to a child-term parent-term relation. The \n",

    "\n",
    "- part_of: Describes the relation between subclasses and a class where the class can only be instantiated if **every** subclass is present (as instance). E.g. a \"cell\" cannot exist without all of its crucial parts, therefore \"cell membrane\" is part_of \"cell\".\n",
    "- xref: Describes cross-reference between different ontologies. Often used for synonyms when dealing with multiple ontologies at once. E.g. \"Organism\" in OBI ontology can be xref of \"organism\" in NCBIT ontology."
