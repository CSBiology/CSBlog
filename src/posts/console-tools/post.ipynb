    "## What are console apps?\n",
    "Console apps are, as the name suggests, applications that run in a console. That is any command-line interface (CLI) that can serve as an output for such an application.  \n",
    "In Windows, these are the Command Prompt (CMD), PowerShell (PS), and – optionally – Windows Terminal (WT).  \n",
    "Console apps, in contrast to applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), in general, do not support the use of a mouse but instead focus solely on keyboard usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../../img/wt.png)  \n",
    "__Your best friend.__\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Console apps are the easiest way to create an application with very little overhead, since most modern programming language frameworks offer support for creating them. Besides, the complexity of a simple console app is often a lot lower than a GUI-based application of the same functionality, and makes it much easier to create an easily accessible API by calling the console app through a CLI from another application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do .NET console apps work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The .NET ecosystem allows for its core languages C#, F#, and Visual Basic.NET to create console app barebones that work (roughly) the same. You can choose between requiring a .NET SDK installed on your system to execute them, or to have everything packed in a file or folder.  \n",
    "Through various ways, .NET allows for modifying your console app beyond the code that it works on (which we will cover later).\n",
    "\n",
    "### .*proj file\n",
    "\n",
    "C#, F#, and Visual Basic.NET applications and libraries are realized as projects. The information about a project is stored in its [project file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview#project-files). Depending on the language you use, those project file are either ending with `.csproj`, `.fsproj`, or `.vbproj` as file extension. These files are based on the [XML standard](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/xml/xml_overview.htm) and thus can be easily read and edited by developers themselves without the need of other tools to alter them.\n",

    "It's important to know that when executing your app, the function called last will be the starting point of your program. In earlier versions of .NET, the compiler needed a starting point specified and it had to be a function itself (most often titled \"main\") but since .NET 6 this is not true anymore. Though, you can still use the \"main function\" approach.\n",

    "As written before, it is your choice of what is to be required when executing your console app. When deploying framework-dependent, the runtime (i.e. the .NET SDK) *must* be installed for your app to be executable. When deploying self-contained, the runtime is already packed into your app. Both options have their (dis)advantages: In a framework-dependent scenario, the user might need to install the .NET SDK on his device before being able to use your program. This can be annoying for the users of your app, depending on if they work with the .NET framework regularly or having nothing to do with it.  \n",
    "Self-contained executables need more space since they pack the runtime into them (hence the name). This also leads to the problem that the runtime is device-dependent: The .NET SDK for Linux differs from that for Windows which differs from that for MacOS, meaning that you must choose for which operating system (OS) you want to deploy your tool.\n",

Sometimes, especially when you don't have an installer for your application (which will mostly be the case) or you don't want your app users to handle [ZIP archives](https://experience.dropbox.com/resources/what-is-a-zip-file), it might be a good choice to use single file-deployment.

But you are not restricted to that. Most of the MSBuild information can be given directly when deploying the app (see below).  \n",
    "As compiling methods you can choose between building and publishing. When building, all files and dependencies get compiled and an executable will be created. When publishing, building will be executed but on top it will be taken into account that the result shall be used as a whole (in the shape of a file or a folder), thus putting everything together and making it deployable. For normal, you _build_ libraries to use them and _build_ console apps to test them but you _publish_ console apps when you want to distribute them. Since publishing is special to apps in general (but not to libraries), we will focus on it in the following.\n",

    "\n",
    "# relative paths are possible too\n",

    "- `--[word]` or `-[letter]` for argument specifiers (as in Argu!)\n",
    "- Not directly related to APIs, but it is common to return an [exit integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status):\n",
    "  - 0 for successfull termination\n",
    "  - 1 to 255 for any error\n",
    "  - Do this via returning the exit code as the last integer (see .NET 5 Program.fs example above) or use `System.Environment.Exit(code)`\n",
    "- Try to keep your executing source file (default: Program.fs) as clean as possible. Like when working with libraries, try not to pack all the code into 1 source file but instead distribute it according to functionality into modules and classes within respective source files\n",

    "### Data folders\n",
    "\n",
    "The following does not solely apply to console apps but to all applications in general:  \n",
    "More complex apps might need to read or save config or user-specific data. Best practice is to follow common standards for doing so, like [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) which is based on Linux or [directories](https://github.com/dirs-dev/directories-rs#design-goals) which is platform-independent."
