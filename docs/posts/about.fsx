# About this Blog

The CSBlog is the official blog of the Computational Systems Biology workgroup at the TU Kaiserslautern. 

We are a relatively young workgroup, with Jun. Prof. Dr. Timo Muehlhaus being the head of the group. Besides research, creating a functional library including a broad range of computational tools written in F# is one of our major interests. The set of libraries can be viewed and accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/CSBiology).
