module SearchMe

/// This module is meant to be searched in ..\public\bundle.js
/// Notice, that you will get different hits, because it is referenced in App.fs, due to: https://fable.io/docs/your-fable-project/project-file.html
/// "An important thing to note is Fable will translate F# source files to ES2015 modules using JS import. This means that files which 
/// are not referenced by any other will be ignored (except the last file) including side effects. This is different behavior from .NET, 
/// where all files are compiled and executed, regardless of their relationship with the rest of the project."
